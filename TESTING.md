## Testing

To run the tests across all platforms, you want to grab the latest [ChefDK][]
install [VirtualBox][], [Vagrant][], and the following gems into your ChefDK:

* [stove][]
* [dnsimple][dnsimple-gem]

Then run `chef exec rake quick` for unit and style tests.

Use `chef exec rake` for all unit, style, and kitchen tests. Before doing so,
you need to sign up for a [Sandbox API account][sandbox] and generate an account
access token. You'll want to define it as an env var for test kitchen under
`DNSIMPLE_ACCESS_TOKEN`. So you can execute the command like this:

`DNSIMPLE_ACCESS_TOKEN=mytoken chef exec kitchen test`

You will also want to edit the `.kitchen.yml` file to adjust the `test_domain`
attributes to test a domain you create under your sandbox account. In order to
test regional records, you will want to upgrade the account plan to one that
supports the regional records feature.
